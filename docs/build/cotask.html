# in the system are kept in a list maintained by class @c CoTaskList; the

# system scheduler then runs the tasks&#39; @c run() methods according to a

# chosen scheduling algorithm such as round-robin or highest-priority-first.

## Implements multitasking with scheduling and some performance logging.

# 

# This class implements behavior common to tasks in a cooperative

# multitasking system which runs in MicroPython. The ability to be scheduled

# on the basis of time or an external software trigger or interrupt is

# implemented, state transitions can be recorded, and run times can be

# profiled. The user&#39;s task code must be implemented in a generator which

# yields the state (and the CPU) after it has run for a short and bounded

# period of time.

# 

# @b Example:

# @code

# def task1_fun ():

# &#39;&#39;&#39;! This function switches states repeatedly for no reason&#39;&#39;&#39;

# state = 0

# while True:

# if state == 0:

# state = 1

# elif state == 1:

# state = 0

# yield (state)

# 

# \# In main routine, create this task and set it to run twice per second

# task1 = cotask.Task (task1_fun, name = &#39;Task 1&#39;, priority = 1,

# period = 500, profile = True, trace = True)

# 

# \# Add the task to the list (so it will be run) and run scheduler

# cotask.task_list.append (task1)

# while True:

# cotask.task_list.pri_sched ()

# @endcode

class Task:

    ## Initialize a task object so it may be run by the scheduler.
    # 
    #  This method initializes a task object, saving copies of constructor
    #  parameters and preparing an empty dictionary for states.

    #  @param run_fun The function which implements the task&#39;s code. It must
    #         be a generator which yields the current state.

    #         be overridden with a more descriptive name by the programmer.

## A list of tasks used internally by the task scheduler.

# This class holds the list of tasks which will be run by the task scheduler.

# The task list is usually not directly used by the programmer except when

# tasks are added to it and the scheduler is called. An example showing the

# use of the task list is given in the last few lines of the documentation

# for class @c Task.

# 

# The task list is sorted by priority so that the scheduler can efficiently

# look through the list to find the highest priority task which is ready to

# run at any given time. Tasks can also be scheduled in a simpler

# &quot;round-robin&quot; fashion.

class TaskList:

        #  that priority.

    #  tasks first, that has no significant effect in the long run, as all the
