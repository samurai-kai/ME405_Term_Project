ME 405 Line-Following Robot 
===========================

Welcome to our ME 405 Line-Following Robot project! 
This project is a culmination of the skills we have learned in the ME 405 class at Cal Poly. 
The goal of this project is to create a robot that can follow a line on the ground using IR 
sensor and IMU for control. The robot will be able to follow a line on the ground and navigate 
through a series of obstacles.
