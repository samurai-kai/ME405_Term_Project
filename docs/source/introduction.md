# Introduction

This project utilizes the *Pololu Romi Robot* development kit as a starting 
point. To communicate with the Romi hardware, a cooperative-multitasking 
scheduler is implemented in MicroPython. The MicroPython codeoperates on a 
NUCLEO-L476RG board from *ST Microelectronics* and interfaces with
a *Shoe of Brian* device, which allows us to flash code to the NUCLEO via a USB
connection.

This project was completed in a 10-week span in a course lab format. Weekly 
deliverables typically consisted of configuring a hardware component for a 
simple task to be later applied to the overall goal of completing the obstacle 
course. Examples of intermittent deliverables include the incorporation of an IR 
sensor to follow a circular path and the implementation of an IMU to 
continuously orient Romi to face north.
