# ME 405 Line-Following Robot 

**by Kai De La Cruz and Kenzie Goldman**

Welcome to our line-following robot project! 
This project is a culmination of the skills we have learned in the 
**ME 405 Mechatronics** course at Cal Poly. The goal of this project is to 
create a robot that can complete an obstacle course using a variety of sensor 
feedbacks for control.
